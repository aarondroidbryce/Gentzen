# Gentzen

My completed COQ implementation of Gentzen's Consistency Proof for Peano Arithmetic. 

Running the build bash script will compile the project in the correct order.



This code is based off an exisiting attempt by Morgan Sinclaire: https://github.com/Morgan-Sinclaire/Gentzen

The folder Casteran contains an imported library for reasoning about ordinals developed by Pierre Casteran: http://www.labri.fr/~casteran/Cantor/Kantor.tar.gz
